Project Outline:

Objective:
To develop a comprehensive online platform that connects independent math tutors and education centers specializing in the HKDSE curriculum with students, offering features such as personalized tutor profiles, generate HKDSE mock exam question bank, HKDSE student assessment question bank by grading and syllabus, model answer and grading, marking scheme with syllabus reference, scheduling and booking systems, a library of HKDSE-specific math resources, an interactive forum, and a feedback mechanism.

Key Deliverables:
1. A user-friendly online platform with a responsive design, accessible on various devices such as pad (chatbot one side and whiteboard on the other for conversational chat by English, Cantonese and Mandarin) 
2. Personalized tutor profiles with relevant qualifications, experience, subjects taught, and availability of tutor schedule
3. An intuitive scheduling and booking system for tutors and students.
4. A library of HKDSE-specific math resources, including practice tests, past exam paper with question, answer and marking scheme explanation, video lessons, and be-spoken study guides for performance improvement.
5. An interactive forum for ai-powered assistant tutors and students to engage with each other.
6. A feedback mechanism for continuous improvement based on user experiences and suggestions, and individual studentsâ€™ data analytics. 
7. Providing training courses to educator to build their own knowledge base platform for their education activities.
